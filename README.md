# Practicing Python

Implementations of data structures and algorithms in Python.

## Some notes

- Python relative imports make it impossible for me, with the hierarchy of folders that I have chosen, to import via relative imports. Instead, I have just copy and pasted existing folders (linked lists into the queues for example). I could have potentially found a work around by running all of my tests out of the main, parent folder but I felt that this organization felt more "real" to my studying.
